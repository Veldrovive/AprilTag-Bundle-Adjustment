# AprilTag Bundle Adjustment

Implemented as practice after taking ROB501 at the University of Toronto.

A simplified version of the general structure from motion (SFM) problem where we find features using AprilTags instead of using a feature detector like ORB. This also gives us a physical prior on the distance between features allowing us to recover absolute scale.
